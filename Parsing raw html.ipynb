      "In the previous lesson, you were introduced to datatypes - distinct categorizations of data within Python. In the realm of computer science, we frequently encounter diverse forms of data, varying based on the type of information that we want to store on our computers. For instance, when making a program, a developer might find the need to store large amounts of textual elements, such as the individual names of workers at a company, or even the lines of text from a book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only that, but programmers will oftentimes want to manipulate said textual data, such as changing a lowercase word to be completely capitalized, or changing the last name of someone who recently got married in a database. To do so, Python allows us to store textual data inside of the string datatype. In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed withing either a single (\") or double (\"\") quotation marks. It contains letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces, making it a versatile data type commonly used to represent textual information.\n",

      "3: z = x + y\n",

      "Frequently, when working with textual elements such as strings, there arises a need to extract specific segments from the larger string. Consider the case of a string variable named \"boss\" holding the value \"Billy Bob\" as previously demonstrated. How can we isolate the last name from your boss's complete name using Python? This technique of dividing a complete string into distinct portions is referred to as string indexing.\n",
      "The concept of string indexing naturally emerges as a means to systematically arrange and label each character within a provided string. Let's consider the illustration of \"boss = 'Billy Bob\"' as shown before. In this case, our string \"boss\" consists of characters arranged in this order: 'B', 'i', 'l', 'l', 'y', ' ', 'B', 'o', 'b' (note that even the space between the first and last name is considered a character). If the goal is to dissect the complete string \"boss\" into distinct segment, each carrying its unique identifier, we can assign a distinct integer to every character in the string. In the convention adopted by computer scientists, each character is assigned an integer that corresponds to the number of steps or characters required from the start of the string. For instance, in the string \"boss\", the character 'B' would possess the index 0, as it is located at zero positions away from the string's outset, marking it as the initial character.\n",
      "For example, if we had a string called \"Python\", then each character inside of the string \"Python\" would have the following indexes. Remember, indexes are numerical values that represent the location of an element (character) within a group of elements (your string).\n",

      "Let's return to the aforementioned problem of extracting \"Bob\" from the variable boss = \"Billy Bob \". To start, let's begin by just extracting the 'B' from \"Bob\". When you want to extract an individual character from a string, you first name the string, followed by \"[]\". You would then place the index of the desired character inside the square brackets.\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "If I wanted to extract the second 'B' from boss, it would look like so:\n",
      "1: boss = \"Billy Bob \"\n",

      "3: print(c)\n",
      "When run, the above program would display B on your screen, since the second 'B' has the index 6. Since we can concatenate two strings using the \"+\" operator, we could type the following code in order to print Bob onto our screen:\n",
      "1: boss = \"Billy Bob \"\n",
      "2: print(boss[6] + boss[7] + boss[8])\n",

      "2: print(boss[6 : 9])\n",
      "Here, \"Bob\" would still be displayed on our screen; however, the volume of code required is significantly reduced compared to the previous method. When we need to retrieve multiple characters from a given string, the familiar approach of naming the string followed by the square brackets remains unchanged. Instead of directly inputting the index of the desired character, a slight modification is applied. You begin by indicating the index from which the extraction should initiate-this index is included in the extraction. Following that, you specify the index of the character where the string's extraction concludes-this index is excluded. Essentially, the character located at the starting index will be included in the extraction, while the character at the final index will not be encompassed.\n",

The second way to add the numbers one through five would be as follows;\n",

      "List Indexing:\n",
      "Just like with strings, programmers can take a singular item out of a list using list indexing.

To illustrate, envision tackling the intricate challenge of coding a program to compute your owed tax to the government.

Our objective is to make code that possesses the capacity to adapt its output in response to this variable information, demonstrating the versatility that coding can bring to complex and fluid scenarios.\n",

Observe the intentional spacing left between the \"if\" keyword and the ensuing colon. This specific juncture is where our condition, the pivotal criterion, will be inserted. The code residing on line two exclusively executes if this condition evaluates to true. With all conditionals, the conventional structure entails initiating with \"if,\" succeeded by the specified condition, and ultimately culminating in a colon, signifying the conclusion of the declaration. Following this, the code snippet to be executed under the condition's truth is entered. The differentiation of code confined within our conditional is achieved by either indenting it or inserting three spaces, thereby visually segregating its scope\n",

      "Explanation: \t In the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, the Controller serves as the intermediary between the Model and the View. It plays a crucial role in managing user interactions and updating the Model and View components accordingly. The Controller receives input from the user through the View, processes it, and communicates with the Model to update data as needed. Once the Model is updated, the Controller ensures that the appropriate changes are reflected in the View, allowing users to see the updated information on the user interface. Essentially, the Controller acts as the \"middle man\" that orchestrates the flow of data and interactions within the MVC architecture.\n",

      "Explanation: \t A form in HTML is used for capturing user input. It's a way to collect information from the user, such as text, numbers, options, and more. Forms provide fields like text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdowns that users can interact with to provide data. This data can then be sent to a server for processing, such as submitting a search query, creating an account, or completing an online survey. In essence, a form acts as an interactive tool to gather information from users interacting with a web page.\n",

This makes it easy for anyone looking at the URL to see sensitive information like passwords.nGET requests are often cached by web browsers and intermediaries, so sensitive data can potentially be stored in these caches.nSince the data is part of the URL, it might be logged by web servers, proxy servers, and other network devices, leading to a potential security risk.nFor sending sensitive data like passwords, it's recommended to use the POST method instead. The POST method sends data in the request body, which is not visible in the URL and is less likely to be cached or logged. This helps enhance the security of sensitive information during transit.\n",

There are a million different ways you could have drawn this monster, but there are features that it definitely has (it can fly), and some features that could be different.

      "Question: \t What is the purpose of a class in OOP?\n",

      "\n",
      "Explanation: \t In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects. The attributes (also known as properties or fields) in a class define the characteristics of the objects created from that class. These attributes can store data that is unique to each object.nnAdditionally, the class can also define methods (also known as actions or functions) that specify what actions the objects can perform. These methods can operate on the attributes of the objects and provide functionalities.\n",

      "\n",
      "Explanation: \t In Python, when defining methods within a class, the first parameter of the method is conventionally named \"self\". \"Self\" refers to the instance of the class itself. When you create an object from a class, that object is an instance of the class. By convention, you use \"self\" to refer to the instance within its own methods.\n",

      "An API is a set of rules, instructions, and tools for building software applications. Kind of like a messenger that delivers your request to the provider that your requesting it from and then delivers the response back to you.\n",
      "An API may be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware, or software library.\n",
      "A user interface (the last part of API acronym) is how we as humans interact with an application. Interfaces are how we communicate with a machine, or how they communicate with each other.\n",
      "What does an API look like?\n",
      "The internet is filled with cool APIs! Some examples include...\n",
      "Amazon! Using the Amazon Product Advertising API, a third party web site can post direct links to Amazon products with updated prices and an option to \"buy now\"\n",
      "In the same way that Solitaire waits for you to click on a card to do something, a web server runs a program that waits for a person to ask it for a web page. Google and Bing work like this.\n",
      "Google Maps has multiple APIs, so does Twitter and Facebook!\n",
      ".\n",
      "What is the purpose of an API?\n",
      "An API simplifies programming by only exposing objects or actions the developer needs.\n",
      "An API for a file input/outpu might give the developer a function that copies a file from one location to another without requiring the developer to understand the file system operations occuring behind the scenes.\n",
      "A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.\n",
