 In the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, the Controller serves as the intermediary between the Model and the View. It plays a crucial role in managing user interactions and updating the Model and View components accordingly. The Controller receives input from the user through the View, processes it, and communicates with the Model to update data as needed. Once the Model is updated, the Controller ensures that the appropriate changes are reflected in the View, allowing users to see the updated information on the user interface. Essentially, the Controller acts as the \"middle man\" that orchestrates the flow of data and interactions within the MVC architecture.
